I am a PhD researcher at the University of Cambridge supervised by Dr. Adrian Wonfor and Prof. Richard Penty. My PhD is part of the [photonic and quantum technologies division](https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/photonic-and-quantum-technologies/) in the department of electrical engineering. I am part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Connected Electronic and Photonic Systems](https://www.ceps-cdt.org/) at University College London. I am also affiliated with the [UK Quantum Communications hub](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/) and [BT](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/industry-government-media/collaboration-opportunities/case-studies/bt/).

I am interested in the physics, engineering and computer science of continuous-variable quantum networks with particular application to quantum cryptography. Some related notes, updated on occasion, can be found ~~here~~ (Link update soon).

I am a member of the Institute of Physics, a student member of the IEEE, a member of Gonville & Caius College and a fellow (member) of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.
