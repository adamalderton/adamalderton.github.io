I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by Dr. Adrian Wonfor and Prof. Richard Penty. My PhD is part of the photonic and quantum technologies division of the department of electrical engineering. I am grateful to be supported by the 

I research the theory and implementation of entanglement-based quantum networking for various applications including distributed/modular quantum computing and quantum key distribution. My research converges ideas from physics, electrical engineering and computer science. As part of this field my research interests include quantum technologies, cryptography and machine learning.
