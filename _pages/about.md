I am a PhD candidate in the electrical engineering department of the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Richard Penty. My PhD is part of the [photonic and quantum technologies division](https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/photonic-and-quantum-technologies/) in the department of electrical engineering. I am part of the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Connected Electronic and Photonic Systems](https://www.ceps-cdt.org/) at University College London. I am also affiliated with the [UK Quantum Communications hub](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/).

I am interested in the physics, engineering and computer science of continuous-variable quantum communication systems with particular application to quantum cryptography. In particular, I study how practicalities justified from a communications engineering perspective may be further justified using ideas from quantum information theory.
