I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by Dr. Adrian Wonfor and [Prof. Richard Penty](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/rvp11). My PhD is part of the [photonic and quantum technologies division](https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/photonic-and-quantum-technologies/) in the department of electrical engineering. I am grateful to be supported by the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Connected Electronic and Photonic Systems](https://www.ceps-cdt.org/) at University College London. I am also grateful for the support of the [UK Quantum Communications hub](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/).

I am interested in the theory and implementation of entanglement-based quantum networks for various applications including modular quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

I am a member of Gonville & Caius college, a member of the IoP and a student member of the IEEE.
