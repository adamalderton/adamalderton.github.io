I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by Dr. Adrian Wonfor and [Prof. Richard Penty](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/rvp11). My PhD is part of the [photonic and quantum technologies division](https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/photonic-and-quantum-technologies/) in the department of electrical engineering. I am grateful to be supported by the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Connected Electronic and Photonic Systems](https://www.ceps-cdt.org/) at University College London.

I research the theory and implementation of entanglement-based quantum networking for various applications including distributed/modular quantum computing and quantum key distribution. My research brings together ideas from physics, electrical engineering and computer science. Tangentially, my research interests include cryptography and machine learning.

I am a member of Gonville & Caius college, the Institure of Physics (IoP) and of the IEEE.

Please feel free to get in touch via my email as given in the left pane of this website.
