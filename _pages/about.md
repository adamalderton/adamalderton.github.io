I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by Dr. Adrian Wonfor and Prof. Richard Penty. My PhD is part of the [photonic and quantum technologies division](https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/photonic-and-quantum-technologies/) in the department of electrical engineering. I am grateful to be supported by the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Connected Electronic and Photonic Systems](https://www.ceps-cdt.org/) at University College London. I am also grateful for the support of the [UK Quantum Communications hub](https://www.quantumcommshub.net/).

I am interested in the physics, engineering and computer science of continuous-variable entanglement-based quantum networks for various applications, particularly quantum cryptography.

Please feel free to get in touch with me via my [email](mailto:aa2301@cam.ac.uk).
