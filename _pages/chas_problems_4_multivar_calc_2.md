# Problem Sheet 5 - Multivariate Calculus 2

## 1)
Convert the following two-dimensional points from a cartesian coordinate representation to a polar coordinate representation. Angles considered should be in radians.

$$
(2, 3)
$$

$$
(4, -7)
$$

Convert the following two-dimensional point defined in polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates.

$$
(\rho = 10, \phi = \frac{3}{4}\pi)
$$

Hint: For all three, it helps a lot if you do a brief sketch of a 2D axis. You will need to use trigonometry!

## 2)

Consider the following three-dimensional point in cartesian space:

$$
(3, -3, 5).
$$

Find the representation of the same point in cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates.

Hints:
- Pythagoras' theorem works in 3D too!
- Do not use formulas found online - you will not know which is theta and which is phi etc. Plus, I need to see all working out!
- Cylindrical is likely easier than spherical, so probably start with that.

## 3)

Do the following with the following function:
- A) Find the partial derivative with respect to $x$.
- B) Find the partial derivative with respect to $y$.
- C) Find the partial derivative with respect to $z$.
- D) Evaluate the integral $\int_0^2 f dy$
- E) Evaluate the integral $\int_0^\pi \int_0^3 f dz dx$

$$
f(x, y, z) = x^2 + 3y^3 + \sqrt{z}\cos(x)
$$

## 4)

Use Green's theorem to evaluate the line integral

$$
\oint(-x^2y \space dx \space + \space xy^2 \space dy)
$$

around a circle centred on (0, 0) of radius 2.

## 5)
Do problem 9.3 of chapter 6 of *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences* by Mary Boas, 3rd Edition. (Uploaded on Google drive).

Hints:
- Use Green's theorem.
- Consider splitting the area into two smaller areas.
  
**Extra points**:
Actually do the line integral around the area to show that Green's theorem does hold for this case.

## 6)

Why could we not apply Green's theorem to the function

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{5\cos(x)}{x^2 + y^2}
$$

when it is considered in the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$?
