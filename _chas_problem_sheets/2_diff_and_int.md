This problem sheet should test you on all previous knowledge in the course! Topics people struggled on are more frequent in this problem sheet.

---
1) Find $A$.

$$

A = \frac{d}{dx}\left( 4x^{\frac{2}{3}} + \sin(x)\right)

$$

---
2) Find the $x$ value(s) for when the following function is stationary.

$$

f(x) = x^3 e^{2x}

$$

---
3) Find $Q$.

$$

Q = \int_{-5}^{3} x^{12} + 34 \space dx

$$

---
4) Describe, in words, what you think integration is. What concept does it (roughly) come from? Also, when do you need to include the integration constant "$+ \space C$" and what does it mean?

---
5) Find $X$.

$$
\log_3(243) = X
$$

---
6) Find $Y$.

$$
Y = \int_{2}^{3} \frac{3}{x} \space dx 
$$

---
7) Find $Z$. (Yes the integration limits are the right way round).

$$
Z = \int_2^{-1} x^2 + e^x \space dx
$$

---
8) Find $B$.

$$

B = \int \frac{x}{e^x} \space dx
