A short but challenging problem sheet to wrap things up!

## 1)

Evaluate the following integral:

$$
I = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}4x\cos(x)dx
$$

---
## 2)

Evaluate the following integral:

$$
I = \int \tan(\theta)d\theta
$$

Hint: Do not use integration by parts.

---
## 3)

A star has a non-uniform density as a function of distance from its core given by the following function:

$$
\rho(r) = \frac{1}{r}
$$

Find the total mass of the star if it has a radius $R$.

Hint: A star is a giant sphere. When density is constant throughout a volume, $\rho = \frac{M}{V}$ where $M$ is the total mass and $V$ is the volume.

## 4)

There exists a vector field

$$
\mathbf{A} = (y^2, y, xz).
$$

Find the divergence and curl of this vector field.

---
## 5)

Consider the function

$$
f(x, y) = 2x + xe^y
$$

in the region $-3 \leq x \leq 3$, $-3 \leq y \leq 3$. Show that Green's theorem holds for this case.

Hint: Evaluate both sides of Green's theorem.
