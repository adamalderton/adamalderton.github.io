## 1)

Rationalise/Realise the following expressions:

$$
\frac{3x}{\sqrt{x}}, \space \space \space \frac{3}{2\sqrt{x}}, \space \space \space \frac{4}{2 + i}, \space \space \space \frac{\pi}{3i}
$$

---

## 2)

Evaluate the following expression:

$$
\Gamma = \int_0^\infty \log_2(x) \space \delta(x - 16) \space dx
$$

---

## 3)

Consider the function:

$$
f(x) = e^{x^2 + y}\sin(3y) + \sqrt{y}
$$

Find:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \space \text{and} \space \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

## 4)

The one-dimensional time-independent Schr$\text{\"o}$dinger equation describing a free particle has the following form:

$$
\hat{H}\Psi = E \Psi
$$

where

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2}{2m}
$$

and 

$$
\hat{\mathbf{p}} = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}.
$$

Show that a solution to this form of the Schr$\text{\"o}$dinger is

$$
\Psi(x) = e^{ikx}.
$$

Finally, find the energy of the particle $E$.

Note: This question is easier than it looks! You do *not* have to do A-level physics to be able to do it. This question is however about quantum mechanics. Ignore anything you don't understand! For example, don't worry about things like $\hbar$ or $k$, they are just constants in this case!

Hint: Do not actually solve the differential equation from scratch.

## 5)

Evaluate the following expression:

$$
I = \int_{-5}^0 \int_2^4 (x + y^2) \space dx dy
$$

---

## 6)

Evaluate the following expression:

$$
I = \int_0^{x^2}\int_0^6 (x - y) dx dy
$$

---

## 7)

Find the area enclosed by the following curves:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2
$$
$$
g(x) = \sqrt{x}
$$

by two methods:
- Simple integration and subtraction.
- Two-dimensional integration.

## 8)

Find the length of the line described by the curve

$$
f(x) = x^3 + 1
$$

between $x = 1$ and $x = 2$.
