### 12)
For the function defined below, find the value(s) of $x$ that correspond to a stationary point.
$$
f(x) = 3x^2
$$

Formally, determine the nature of the stationary point. (Hint: Is it a maximum, a minium or an inflection point)?

### 13)
Find the stationary point(s) of the function defined below:
$$
f(x) = \sin(x)
$$
where the stationary points are bounded by $-\pi \leq x_0 \leq \pi$ where $x_0$ is an $x$ value corresponding to a stationary point.

### 14)

For the function defined below, find the values of $x$ the correspond to a stationary point. For the stationary points found, formally determine the nature of the stationary point.

$$
f(x) = x^3 - x^2
$$

### 15)

There is no question 15, oops. I got the numbers wrong but I've already made the solutions so this is staying here!

### 16)
Find $I$:

$$
I = \int_0^4 x \space  dx
$$

### 17)

Evaluate $I$:
$$
I = \int x^3 - x^{-2} + 3 \space dx
$$

### 18)

Evaluate $I$:

$$
I = -3\int_0^\pi \cos(x) \space dx
$$

### 19)

Evaluate the integral of the curve between the values of $-2$ and $5$:
$$

f(x) = x^4 + 6

$$

### 20) (Challenge)

A painter is painting a purple line. The paint is loaded in her brush in a highly non-linear fashion such that it leaves the brush at a varying rate. The amount of paint transferred to the page as a function of the distance is determined by a second order polynomial with no linear term. The brush, when first applied, starting deposit paint at a rate of 3 ml per centimetre. The brush stops applying paint entirely when the brush has traveled $\sqrt{7}$ centremetres. Determine the volume of purple paint used.

Hint: 'No linear term' implies that the coefficient of the $x^1$ term in the polynomial is 0.
